# Project Name: I Need A Hero

## Project aim
The site's aim is to provide a place for users to share characters 
they no longer need, or to find character ideas from those uploaded from other users.
The site targets fantasy writers firstly but the character lists can be utilised by role-players
or anyone with an idea they like to share.

Firstly the site to benefit the user community, and secondly to grow a user database and run competitions
via the monthly newletter with user-submitted short-stories and awards for best uploads.


## UX
